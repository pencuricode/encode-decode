# Encode-Decode

```js
<Quick Introduction>
In computers, encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters 
(letters, numbers, punctuation, and certain symbols) 
into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage. 
Decoding is the opposite process -- 
the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters.
